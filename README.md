## Next Steps
Future enhancements for iEvent include:


### Advanced Reporting: 
Generate comprehensive financial reports for an in-depth analysis of event expenses and contributions.
### Approval Process:

We plan to introduce a feature where users can send a request to join an event, which must be approved by the host before they can participate. This will give hosts better control over their event's attendance and ensure that only approved participants can access event details and contribute to its finances.
### Activity-Based Financial Tracking:

We plan to introduce a comprehensive system for hosts to create and manage different activities within each event. Participants will be able to see a breakdown of costs for each activity and choose which activities they want to join. 
### Automated Participant Expense Calculation:

Automatically calculate and display the amount each participant owes for the events they've chosen to join

Participants can access a real-time breakdown of their expenses, contributions, and outstanding payments, ensuring clarity and accountability.
